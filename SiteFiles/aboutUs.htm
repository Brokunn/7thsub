<h1>About The Taylors</h1>
<!-- InstanceEndEditable --> 
	
	<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" --> 
  
<p>Bill and Jan Taylor grew up and live in Montana.  Bill has MA 
degrees in English and history.  He served in the US Army and taught 
English in Montana high schools for 35 years.  Jan has a BA in <br>
English and German and has taught both in the Montana public schools.
	Both developed a love for Montana history by traveling, 
researching and photographing the state's ghost towns and railroad 
sites.  They have an extensive photo record of both.  In addition 
they have walked most every railroad line (including the abandoned 
ones) in western Montana.</p>
<p>
	Bill has lectured to a variety of groups and has had articles 
appear in several journals such as the Northern Pacific Railway 
Historical Association's &quot;Mainstreeter,&quot; &quot;The Montana Magazine&quot; and 
&quot;The Milwaukee Railroader.&quot;  In addition he has conducted railroad 
related classes for Elderhostel and the Glacier Institute.  Jan 
currently serves as the Vice President of the Northern Pacific 
Railway Historical Association and will organize the 2006 NPRHA 
convention in Bozeman, MT. Bill and Jan have just completed a five 
year stint being the onboard narrators and managers for the Montana 
Daylight tour train that ran between Livingston and Sandpoint.
They also have served as host-lecturers aboard the Grandluxe (formerly the American Orient Express).
	These interests have so far resulted in four books that touch 
on Montana, mining and railroad history.  They are:  <em><a href="ourBooks.htm#butteShortLine">The 
    Butte Short Line</a></em> the story of the Northern Pacific's construction and early 
operation of the Homestake Pass crossing of the continental divide 
near Butte, Montana. <em><a href="ourBooks.htm#railsGoldSilver">Rails 
    to Gold and Silver: Volume I</a></em> and <em><a href="ourBooks.htm#railsGoldSilver2">Rails 
    to Gold and Silver: Volume II</a></em> which 
document 13 branch lines that were built to the gold and silver 
mining regions in the 1880s and 90s by the Northern Pacific Railroad. 
And Northern Pacific's <a href="ourBooks.htm#mullanPass"><em>The Mullan Pass</em></a> - the story of the construction 
and early operations of the NP's main continental divide crossing 
west of Helena.  All four of these books are available through this 
site.</p>
<p>
	Finally, Bill and Jan own their own railroad motorcar and 
have traveled over 5000 miles of railroad in their &quot;speeder.&quot;  Bill 
serves as the president of Pacific Railcar Operators and Jan is the 
former editor of the &quot;Setoff,&quot; the magazine of the North American 
Rail Car Owners Association.</p>
<p>
	Their home is in Missoula.<br>
